As the sun rises east, you can feel your heart drop with dread in your chest as the sounds of screams and clashing steel rise from the west. With fear seizing your heart, you realize that the village you called home is under attack from an orc raid. 

Your instincts scream at you to run for the northern woods, away from the flames and danger, as you stumble through the fields. Tears sting your eyes as you desperately try to avoid being caught, your adrenaline surging with each ragged breath as you push yourself to move faster and faster.

Your heart beats in your ears as you race through the tall grasses and shrubs, desperate to put as much distance between yourself and the orc horde as possible. Every breath you take burns in your chest, and you feel tears streaming down your cheeks as your body struggles to keep up with your frantic flight. The adrenaline coursing through your veins pushes you forward, despite your growing exhaustion.

Eventually, you reach the edge of a forest at the base of a mountain, and you have the distinct sensation that it is the only chance you have at surviving this encounter. Your feet hit the soft forest floor, and you push yourself forward, your arms pumping as you navigate through the dense trees and bushes.

You ascend the gentle slope of the mountain's foothills, and soon you find yourself surrounded by trees that have lost their color.  Where there are no trees, there are large, jagged rocks. Even though you are in the woods, the lack of leaves allows you to see the sun rising. Your breath forms white puffs of fog as you run. 

Finally, your stamina fails you and you kneel down, exhausted. Your clothing and pants are torn and wet, clinging to your skin. You wipe the sweat from your brow, but it doesn't help. 

You look south and see no signs of pursuit. The only footprints you see are yours. But the trees could be playing a lie on you. 

However, you know the orcs were quicker and stronger than you. You must be safe from the orcs. If they were chasing you, they would have caught you by now. 

You lie down and take a rest on the side of a boulder, keeping an eye out south. The air is still.  Except for your breathing, the forest is quiet.

Soon, a girl from the neighboring village approaches. She wears a tanned hooded dress with long sleeves. You recognize her as Tent, even though you don't know her very well. She is covered in soot and being chased by two green goblins. They're holding makeshift spears made from sticks and remnants of kitchen knives, laughing at the prey that stumbled into their home. 

As your eyes meet Tent's, you instantly sense the overwhelming fear in her widened gaze. With urgency, she races towards you, her voice trembling as she cries out, "Please, I need your help! There are six goblins!"

Goblins are wicked spirits that emerge from trees to prey on the bounty of the forest. Unlike orcs, who are too large to flit between the trees, goblins can navigate through the woods with agility. It would be better to kill them here than to run. 

As she runs toward you, you jump up and extend your right hand. Focusing on one of the small creatures you see, you feel for its neck with your expanded consciousness.

You grab the goblin by the neck, feeling its flesh in your palm as it stands a few dozen yards away. You squeeze hard, but you can't break its neck. 

Instead, you concentrate on tearing off some flesh in its throat and lodging it inside so it can't breathe. After taking a few more steps, he falls to the ground in a heap. 

By the time Tent reaches you, you can hear the goblins laughing as they begin to surround you, their spears pointing in your direction. They're making strange gestures and pointing at their genitals.

Before the goblins can charge you and Tent, you concentrate on tearing up the throat of another goblin again. 

You feel the adrenaline rush back to your veins, your senses on high alert. The goblin lunges at Tent with his spear, but Tent twists out of the way, her hand flashing out. She twists her fingers into a tiger claw and plunges her fingers into the goblin's eyes. She pulls her fingers back with a wet sound, and the goblin collapses onto the ground.

A goblin is trying to sneak around Tent as she is occupied with the one in front of her. As you focus on it, you hear the thwack of a rock hitting your ribs, causing you to lose concentration. You turn your head to see that another goblin is pelting you with rocks, distracting you from focusing on your own goblin.

In the confusion, Tent has managed to pull the knife out of the first goblin's spear and has buried it into the throat of the third goblin. Blood sprays everywhere as the goblin gurgles and falls to the ground.

The final pair of goblins, aware of their inferiority, turn back to flee into the woods.

You concentrate on the nearest goblin and grab for his groin with a closed fist, using your extended mind. As he stops thrusting his hips in the air and says, "Grah?" you can feel his little genitalia in your hand. You clench your hand into a fist as disgusting sticky orange blood spurts out from his pelvis. He collapses to the ground.

Tent wrinkles her nose at the sight.

The goblins let out a wild cry. One of them approaches you, brandishing a spear. You step back, focusing for his neck, but he moves too swiftly for you catch him, and jabs at you with his spear. You slowly step back, careful to dodge, your focus fixated on his neck.

A goblin charges at Tent, spear in hand. She swiftly dodges the attack and lands a powerful punch to the goblin's chest, leaving him breathless. Grabbing a nearby rock, she smashes it onto the goblin's head, leaving him dazed. With a swift kick, she knocks him to the ground and takes his spear, impaling him with it.

After gaining control over the goblin, you mercilessly rip into his neck, completely shredding it. The goblin writhes in excruciating pain as blood spurts out from his neck, causing him to stagger backwards from the sheer brutality of your attack.

In the midst of chaos, the terrified goblin lunges at Tent with his spear, but she gracefully evades his attack. Tent retaliates with a mighty swing of her rock, shattering the goblin's face with a resounding crunch. Seizing the opportunity, she grabs his spear and relentlessly pierces the goblin until its lifeless form lies motionless in a puddle of sap like blood.

Aware of their inferiority, the final pair of goblins turn back to flee into the woods.

Tent is determined to pursue them, but you intervene, halting her in her tracks. As she turns to face you, her gaze meets yours, yet your attention is captivated by the injury she bears. Right above her elbow, a protruding wooden stick juts out. The wound oozes a mesmerizing crimson hue, gracefully staining her once pristine sleeves. Tent's eyes follow your gaze, and a flicker of surprise dances across her face, as if she had been oblivious to the wound's existence amidst the chaos of the battle.

She stretches her hand towards the stick, gripping it tightly. Tent's nostrils flare as she yanks the stick out of her arm. A deep cut is left behind, revealing the raw muscle beneath. You can see fragments of shattered stick remain embedded in the wound, but it doesn't look like the injury reached the bone.

Tent, wincing from her effort, asks, "Are they gone?" 

You gaze towards the path where the goblins disappeared. "They're gone," you mutter. Drawing closer to Tent, you inspect her injury. Splinters of wood now reside within her tender flesh, the should be extracted.

Letting them flee will just result in more goblins coming at you later. You use your telekinesis to grab one by the neck and choke them.

Tent sees your magic at work and sprints towards the other goblin, tackling them down to the ground. She attempts to stab them with a nearby stick, but they twist their body to catch it and instead press the end into her arm, causing her to yelp in pain.

Taking advantage of the situation, you quickly finish your goblin off. Tent is still engaged in her battle with the goblin. As she wrestles with him, he manages to lodge the stick even deeper in her arm, causing her to scream out in pain. She pushes his head back, giving you a good view of his face. He has an inhuman evil grin full of sadism. He kicks at her knees, pushing her to the ground, laying himself on tip of her. He shouts as he lifts his arms up to start pummeling her. 

But you merely grab his throat as well, doing to him what you did to the others. As he suffocates, Tent pushes him off of her, and stomps on his chest. Breaking his sternum and quite possibly impaling his heart with those bone fragments. 

She stretches her hand towards the stick, gripping it tightly. Tent's nostrils flare as she yanks the stick out of her arm. A deep cut is left behind, revealing the raw muscle beneath.

You ask Tent if you could clean up her wound, explaining that there's more wood in the wound, and it'll get infected if left untreated.

She frowns, but after a moment, she relents, relaxing her arm and giving it to you. 

You carefully probe at the wound with your telekinesis to sense for splinters in her muscle. She looks away from you and her wound. It must be unpleasant for her. 

Perhaps looking for a distraction, Tent finds the suffocated goblins and asks, "What did you do to those goblins?"  

You slide a small shard of wood out from her muscle with your telekinesis. Looking at it, you see it glinting in the sun, completely covered with Tent's blood. You let it float away into the woods. "I used my telekinesis to cut a portion of their throat, so they'd suffocate on their own flesh and blood." 

Fierce brown eyes turn to look at you, now wide open, before quickly looking away. "That's... very scary. I didn't know you could do that." 

You nod, and reach to another piece of wood that is protruding from the wound, carefully removing it. "It's not really useful in close combat." You say, and nod at her wounded arm, "I wish I could've prevented you getting hurt." 

She glares at you. "Don't be stupid! You could probably stop a sword mid swing!" 

You laugh, "No no, I'm not that strong." 

You finish your work, and find that there is no more splinters lodged into her muscle, just a lot of succulent blood. She is still breathing heavy from the fighting, the adrenaline likely helping her with the pain.  

She pulls away from you. Striding to a jagged boulder, she sits down on it. "Let's rest for a bit." She pulls her hood, attached to her dress, over her head.

[[Continue->1H]]

You decide to let Tent tend to herself. Tent stares at her wound, studying it. Then she reaches into it with her other hand, digging around. Her blood is going everywhere, her hands, her dress, the ground... After a while of doing this, she pulls out a shard. 

The process is messy, and while mesmerizing, you decide to look away.  After what seems like several minutes, Tent manages to extract all the splinters. "It hurts, but I should be alright."

Hurting should be an understatement. Tent's eyes are sunken and tearing up from the pain. "Hmph!" She scoffs. Striding to a sunlit boulder, she sits down on it. "Let's rest for a bit." She pulls her hood, attached to her dress, over her head.

[[Continue->1H]]

After resting for a moment, Tent grabs the hem of her dress, and tugs at it. 

"What are you doing?", you ask. 

Tent doesn't answer, instead opting to flap her dress right in front of you, letting you see her socks peeking out from her boots, and above that, her smooth knees.

You decide to let her do her thing in peace, and look over the woods. The sun shines on you as well, so you decide to pull your hood over your head as well. Perhaps unusual, but it seemed that everyone had hoods attached to their clothing in your village.

Eventually, the sound of fabric ripping grabs your attention. Tent has managed to tear a strip off from the bottom of her dress... It'll be exposing just a little bit of her calves whenever she walks now. 

With a surprisingly deft arm, she quickly wraps the fabric to her arm, tying a neat loop at the end, as though she was used to dressing wounds with just one hand. 

"Where did you learn to make bandages like that?" you ask. 

She frowns as she reminisces. "My father is... was careless at farm work..." She left the rest of her sentence unsaid. 

You can remember an enormous orc bursting through the wall of your home, sending shards of wood flying in every direction. In just a split second, he snatched up your little brother and slammed him to the ground with a deafening thud. You'll never be able to unsee your brother squirming on the floor as the orc pounded him deeper into it.

Perhaps talking about family wouldn't be the best idea right now.  

...but her response didn't answer how she was able to do that with just one hand.
