This is where we generate the EPUB.

jEpub: ISC License
https://github.com/lelinhtinh/jEpub/tree/master

jEpub is simpler to use, so we will start with that. If there are any issues, we will instead try out other repositories.

js-epub-maker: MIT License
https://github.com/bbottema/js-epub-maker/tree/master

js-epub-maker does exactly what it sounds like, but it is more complicated.

Currently FileSaver.js is being used to save EPUBs and HTML documents. However, StreamSaver.js may be better for exceptionally large EPUBs. https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js
